# Physio Medical

Physio Medical is a Website that enables people seeking assistance with physical pain to read information about that pain and also conveniently arrange an appointment. With a simple yet attractive homepage that will briefly explain what we do and how we can help. A treatments pain which anyone suffering with pain can relate to and read information about. Then finally a contact us page which allows them to contact the practice or look at their location via google maps. This website is specifically for people seeking a Physical Therapist in their local area so they can arrange an appointment and seek treatment ASAP.

The aim of my project was to build a functional, practical and responsive website using CSS and HTML.

## Features

### Social Media Header 

The first thing I built for my website was the Social Media Header. I wanted to have my social media icons in the header and the footer for additional visibility. The header icons also include Phone & Email contact buttons for convenience. 

- Social Media Header is featured on all pages. Was created using a simple layout with hover effects.
- The only media query required is to ``text-align: center;``

### Navigation and Logo

In my Mockup I had different plans for the header, but changed my mind when it came to implementing the code. Due to having a small navigation, I liked the idea of centering the logo and navigation menus to make better use of space on more popular viewing devices.

- Logo & Navigation is present on all pages and is fully responsive.
- I used Flexbox for my header container to ensure responsiveness and to reduce the amount of media queries required.
- Navigation has a unique and stylish hover effect with a .5s transition set. This specific effect is only viewable on desktop devices.

### Home Page

I wanted a simple homepage design that can talk about how we as a Physical Therapist practice can help somebody in pain and to have the ability to link them to internal pages to provide them with additional assistance. I learned about CSS Grid and wanted to use CSS Grid on my home page to create achieve a responsive page with few media queries.

- Just like my Mockup I did a simple 4 box layout, Image Left, Text Right. Then on a new row, Text Left and Image Right. 
- Each text box has a H2 and a button to bring the visitor to the appropriate page.
- Full width hero image this hero image design is utilized on all internal pages.
- This section provides the user with nice imagery and quick understanding on the next steps of seeking treatment.

### Footer

- Links open up in new tabs so the customer can easily navigate back to the website.
- Contact Information & Copyright information also present.
- Used a contrasting dark shade of grey to compliment the chosen design colour.
