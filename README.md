# Physio Medical

Physio Medical is a Website that enables people seeking assistance with physical pain to read information about that pain and also conveniently arrange an appointment. With a simple yet attractive homepage that will briefly explain what we do and how we can help. A treatments pain which anyone suffering with pain can relate to and read information about. Then finally a contact us page which allows them to contact the practice or look at their location via google maps. This website is specifically for people seeking a Physical Therapist in their local area so they can arrange an appointment and seek treatment ASAP.

The aim of my project was to build a functional, practical and responsive website using CSS and HTML.

## Features

### Social Media Header 

The first thing I built for my website was the Social Media Header. I wanted to have my social media icons in the header and the footer for additional visibility. The header icons also include Phone & Email contact buttons for convenience. 

- Social Media Header is featured on all pages. Was created using a simple layout with hover effects.
- The only media query required is to ``text-align: center;``

### Navigation and Logo

In my Mockup I had different plans for the header, but changed my mind when it came to implementing the code. Due to having a small navigation, I liked the idea of centering the logo and navigation menus to make better use of space on more popular viewing devices.

- Logo & Navigation is present on all pages and is fully responsive.
- I used Flexbox for my header container to ensure responsiveness and to reduce the amount of media queries required.
- Navigation has a unique and stylish hover effect with a .5s transition set. This specific effect is only viewable on desktop devices.

### Home Page

I wanted a simple homepage design that can talk about how we as a Physical Therapist practice can help somebody in pain and to have the ability to link them to internal pages to provide them with additional assistance. I learned about CSS Grid and wanted to use CSS Grid on my home page to create achieve a responsive page with few media queries.

- Just like my Mockup I did a simple 4 box layout, Image Left, Text Right. Then on a new row, Text Left and Image Right. 
- Each text box has a H2 and a button to bring the visitor to the appropriate page.
- Full width hero image this hero image design is utilized on all internal pages.
- This section provides the user with nice imagery and quick understanding on the next steps of seeking treatment.

### Footer

- This section includes links to each relevant social media platform.
- Links open up in new tabs so the customer can easily navigate back to the website.
- Contact Information & Copyright information also present.
- Used a contrasting dark shade of grey to compliment the chosen design colour.

### Treatments

My Treatments page enables the User to quickly choose what pain they are suffering with. It contains a short intro to the benefits of Physical Therapy and by clicking More Info on one of the pain types, it will anchor to the appropriate text which also has a Contact Us button so they can get in touch with the practice in relation to the pain they're experiencing. This functionality prevents excessive scrolling which is beneficial when on smaller mobile devices. They can access information required with the click of a button. Using anchors prevents the need for additional html pages.

- I used Flexbox to achieve this section, using flexbox reduces the amount of media queries required to make the content fit. I could have used Grid for this also, but wanted my Treatments page to fully utilize flexbox in all design choices.
- More Info will anchor directly to more text associated with the pain type to minimize the amount of scrolling required.
- Convenient and Flexible section that contains image, h2, text and call to action button with a grety background to make each section pop.
