                            <p>Neck pain, also known as cervicalgia, is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck pain at some point in their lives.<br><br>

                            Neck pain, although felt in the neck, can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical vertebrae. Joint disruption in the neck creates pain, as does joint disruption in the upper back.
                            
                            The head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck pain.<br><br>
                            
                            Neck pain affects about 5% of the global population as of 2010. Contact us now for a consultation.</p>

                        <p>Back pain is pain felt in the back. It may be classified as neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected. 
                            The lumbar area is the most common area affected. An episode of back pain may be acute, subacute or chronic depending on the duration. 
                            The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain or a burning sensation. 
                            Discomfort can radiate to the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness or weakness in the legs and arms.<br><br>

                        <p>Chronic pain is classified as pain that lasts longer than three to six months. In medicine, the distinction between acute and chronic pain is sometimes determined by the amount of time since onset. 
                            Two commonly used markers are pain that continues at three months and six months since onset, but some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at twelve months. 
                            Others apply the term acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days, chronic to pain of more than six months duration, and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months. 
                            A popular alternative definition of chronic pain, involving no fixed duration, is "pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing".<br><br>

                        <p>Running injuries (or running-related injuries, RRI) affect about half of runners annually. The frequencies of various RRI depend on the type of running, such as speed and mileage. 
                            Some injuries are acute, caused by sudden overstress, such as side stitch, strains, and sprains. Many of the common injuries that affect runners are chronic, developing over longer periods as the result of overuse. 
                            Common overuse injuries include shin splints, stress fractures, Achilles tendinitis, Iliotibial band syndrome, Patellofemoral pain (runner's knee), and plantar fasciitis.<br><br>

                        <p>Shoulder problems including pain, are one of the more common reasons for physician visits for musculoskeletal symptoms. The shoulder is the most movable joint in the body. 
                            However, it is an unstable joint because of the range of motion allowed. This instability increases the likelihood of joint injury, often leading to a degenerative process in which tissues break down and no longer function well.<br><br>

                            Shoulder pain may be localized or may be referred to areas around the shoulder or down the arm. 
                            Other regions within the body (such as gallbladder, liver, or heart disease, or disease of the cervical spine of the neck) also may generate pain that the brain may interpret as arising from the shoulder.

                        <p>Sports injuries are injuries that occur during sport, athletic activities, or exercising. 
                            In the United States, there are approximately 30 million teenagers and children who participate in some form of organized sport. Of those, about three million athletes age 14 years and under experience a sports injury annually.<br><br>
                            When an athlete complains of pain, injury, or distress, the key to diagnosis is a detailed history and examination. 
                            An example of a format used to guide an examination and treatment plan is a S.O.A.P note or, subjective, objective, assessment, plan. 
                            Another important aspect of sport injury is prevention, which helps to reduce potential sport injuries. 
                            It is important to establish sport-specific dynamic warm-ups, stretching, and exercises that can help prevent injuries common to each individual sport.
                            We work and train with a lot of professional athletes, speak to us now to arrange consultation and we can discuss your sports injury.</p>
